              <p>
                In my journey as a web developer, I took on the exciting
                challenge of creating an amazon clone using HTML and CSS. It's
                like a "copy" of Amazon's website, but I built it from scratch
                using basic web development tools. I focused on making it look
                and feel similar to the real Amazon site, so people can explore
                and interact with it just like the actual platform. This project
                helped me improve my skills in building attractive and
                user-friendly websites while also learning about e-commerce
                design. I'm proud of this accomplishment and excited to showcase
                it as a part of my growth as a web developer.

                I successfully designed a login page that looks and feels just
                like Facebook. I used HTML and CSS to design the page and make
                it visually appealing and easy to use. The login interface is
                responsive and works well on different devices. Through this
                project, I improved my front-end development skills and learned
                how to create user-friendly designs. It's a meaningful addition
                to my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to tackle real-world
                design challenges and create practical projects.

              <p>
                I took on the exciting challenge of building a fully functional
                calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.During the process of
                creating the calculator, I encountered various challenges that
                helped me grow as a developer. Implementing the logic for each
                operation and handling edge cases required careful consideration
                and problem-solving skills. I thoroughly enjoyed experimenting
                with different design elements and animations to enhance the
                calculator's visual appeal and create a delightful user
                experience. Through this project, I not only gained proficiency
                in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also fostered a passion for
                creating interactive and practical applications that can make a
                positive impact on users' daily lives.
